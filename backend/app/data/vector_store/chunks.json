[{"video_id": "sample", "chunk_id": "sample-0", "text": "Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. A neural network consists of interconnected units called neurons that process information using connections. The learning occurs through adjusting the weights of these connections. In supervised learning we have input data and target outputs. The network learns by minimizing the error between predicted and actual outputs through a process called backpropagation. Deep learning uses multiple layers to learn hierarchical representations of data. Convolutional neural networks are particularly effective for image processing tasks. Recurrent neural networks handle sequential data like time series and text. Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing with attention mechanisms."}, {"video_id": "sample", "chunk_id": "sample-0", "text": "Principal Component Analysis or PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique widely used in data science. The main idea is to find the directions of maximum variance in the data. These directions are called principal components and form an orthogonal basis. The first principal component has the highest variance, the second has the second highest and so on. PCA helps visualize high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D space. To perform PCA we first center the data by subtracting the mean. Then we compute the covariance matrix and find its eigenvectors. The eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalues are the principal components. PCA preserves as much variance as possible while reducing dimensions. This makes it useful for data visualization and noise reduction."}, {"video_id": "sample", "chunk_id": "sample-0", "text": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence focused on learning from data. There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. In supervised learning we have labeled data with inputs and outputs. Classification is predicting discrete categories while regression predicts continuous values. Unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data through clustering. Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning from interactions with an environment. A model overfits when it learns training data too well and performs poorly on new data. Regularization techniques like L1 and L2 help prevent overfitting. Cross validation is used to estimate model performance on unseen data. Feature engineering is the art of creating informative features for better model performance."}]
